  <p> Throughout my life and career, I have lived, studied, and worked in Europe, South, Central, and North America. 

    Highlights of my  experience encompass:
    
    - Identifying, recruiting, and selecting mid-career multicultural leaders in natural resources from across the world. 
    - Managing and coaching multicultural, multi-age cohorts (up to 10 per year)
    - Managing and constantly improving professional development program
    - Managing stakeholder relationships
    - Streamlining processes and creating efficient systems in program management.
